            <p class="text">This is a project I am still working on and gaining more practice about in order to develop for others their personal portfolios with time. <br>
            I was greatly inspired by a friend's project I saw on his Github account. <br> I am greatly interested in this project because I would also love to inspire young developers into trying it out.
